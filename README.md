# Liqeufaction-induced-lateral-spreadings

This repository contains the data set used in the study titled "Use of Velocity-Based Intensity Measures for Prediction of Lateral Displacements by Artificial Neural Networks" presented at Geocongress 2023. The data set was created by developing the surface slope and free-face ratio values in the data set presented in Ã‡etinkaya (2022) with the digital elevation model.

The data set consists of 487 samples, each of which contains the following information:

* Earthquake
* Borehole
* Fault Type
* Moment Magnitude of Earthquake (Mw)
* Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA)
* Peak Groun Velocity (PGV)
* PGV^2/PGA
* lnIa
* lnCAV5
* Distance from Energy Source in kilometer (R)
* Modified distance from Energy Source for Youd et al. 2002 (R*)
* Log_LSI
* Surface slope (S)
* W
* T15
* NT
* FC15
* D5015
* zcr
* Vs
* Observation
* Reference
