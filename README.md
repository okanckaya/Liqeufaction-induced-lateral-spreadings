# Liqeufaction-induced-lateral-spreadings

This repository contains the data set used in the study titled "Use of Velocity-Based Intensity Measures for Prediction of Lateral Displacements by Artificial Neural Networks" presented at [Geo-Congress 2023](https://www.geocongress.org/) The data set was created by developing the surface slope and free-face ratio values in the data set presented in Ã‡etinkaya (2022) with the digital elevation model.

The data set consists of 487 samples, each of which contains the following information:

* Earthquake
* Borehole
* Fault Type
* Moment Magnitude of Earthquake (M<sub>w</sub>)
* Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA)
* Peak Ground Velocity (PGV)
* PGV<sup>2</sup>/PGA
* Natural logarithm of Arias Intensity (lnI<sub>a</sub>)
* lnCAV<sub>5</sub>
* Distance from Energy Source in kilometer (R)
* Modified distance from Energy Source for Youd et al. 2002 (R*)
* Log of Liquefaction Severity Index (logLSI)
* Surface slope (S)
* Free-face Ratio (W)
* Thickness of Liquefiable Soil Layers with SPT-N<sub>1,60</sub> Lower than 15 (T<sub>15</sub>)
* Non-liquefiable Crust Thickness (CT)
* Fine Content of Soil Layers with SPT-N<sub>1,60</sub> Lower than 15 (FC<sub>15</sub>)
* Mean Particle Diameter of Soil Layers with SPT-N<sub>1,60</sub> Lower than 15 (D50<sub>15</sub>)
* Depth of Most Critical Soil Layer (z<sub>cr</sub>)
* Shear vawe velocity (V<sub>s</sub>)
* Observation
* Reference
